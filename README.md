#### Dataset Information

The dataset has been downloaded from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition

This dataset include data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

##### Deployment on Cloud Platforms

To take this project to the next level, it can be deployed using various cloud platforms that specialize in machine learning services. Some of the most popular platforms include:

AWS SageMaker: SageMaker allows for easy deployment of machine learning models. The platform provides pre-built infrastructure to train, host, and scale models, simplifying the process of deploying a model to a production environment.

Azure Machine Learning: Azure ML provides a managed cloud environment where models can be trained and deployed. It supports integration with other Azure services, making it ideal for creating a complete data pipeline that handles both training and inference.

Google Cloud Vertex AI: Vertex AI offers end-to-end machine learning workflows, enabling users to build, deploy, and scale models with ease. The platform also allows seamless integration with Google Cloud's data services for handling live data streams.

Deploying the model on one of these platforms will enable real-time predictions using live or streaming data. By integrating the project with a cloud-based infrastructure, we can automate the entire machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model deployment and inference.

Why Deploy to the Cloud?

Scalability: Cloud platforms provide the ability to scale the model based on usage, automatically adjusting resources to handle increasing traffic or data volume.

Real-Time Predictions: Deploying the model on the cloud allows for continuous predictions, processing new data as it arrives either in real time or at specified intervals.

End-to-End Automation: Cloud deployment enables automation of the entire ML workflow, from data collection and processing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Cost Efficiency: Using managed cloud services allows for pay-as-you-go pricing, ensuring that you only pay for the resources you use. Additionally, the infrastructure is managed by the cloud provider, reducing operational overhead.
